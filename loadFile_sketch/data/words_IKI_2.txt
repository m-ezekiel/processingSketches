This
no
space
thing
is
hard
as
fuck.
And
to
top
it
off
every
sentence
ending
is
going
to
get
flagged
since
there
is
a
natural
vocal
pause
at
phrasal
endings.
More
code
it
looks
like.
I
think
that
the
saddest
part
to
me
is
how
brittle
this
system
is.
I
really
do
need
to
be
looking
at
the
spaces
that
occur
before
and
after
words.
More
like
does
the
space
come
right
after
a
word
or
right
before
the
next
word.
Hmmm
that
is
an
interesting
question.
I
would
think
that
if
it
comes
immediately
after
a
word
then
that
would
imply
a
continuation
of
thought
and
if
wait
no
if
it
comes
right
after
then
ideas
are
being
composed
in
advance
of
the
next
sequence
of
words.
If
the
pause
occurs
on
the
final
letter
of
a
word
and
then
the
space
is
closer
to
the
next
word
I
would
think
that
implies
revision
type
of
behavior.
Whoa
maybe
onto
something
here.
Bottom
line
is
that
i
can't
ignore
pauses.
